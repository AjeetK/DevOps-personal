Continuous Integration using jenkins
Team works on a project
They code individually and tested individually
When they integrate them, everything breaks
This gives rise to integratin hell

consequencies of integration hell
Risky for the project
May exceed the budget
May exceed the schedule

Continuous Integration is based on the philosophy of "Integrate early and Integrate often" i.e. on every change
Benefits of a CI server
Developers might forget to run the tests
It might take too long to run the tests
We might need to test the code in various environments
